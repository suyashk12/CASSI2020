This repository contains the code pertaining to my work on the chemodynamics of simulated dwarf galaxies.

This work was taken under the mentorship of Dr. Andrew Emerick, post-doctoral fellow of theoretical astrophysics at Carnegie Observatories and Caltech. The analysis has been undertaking by means of GIZMO code (courtesy Dr. Phil Hopkins, professor of theoretical astrophysics at Caltech)

The contents of the repository are as follows -

1. Notebooks - a collection of Jupyter notebooks meant for testing and describing theory.
2. Scripts - contains UNIX executable scripts, extending the ideas from the Jupyter notebooks to any galactic datasets. Any custom information needed, like the location of the working directory or the saving directory, will be requested from the user upon execution of the script.

I am using a snapshot collection from a low-resolution FIRE 2 (courtesy Dr. Phil Hopkins) simulation of the dwarf galaxy m10q. The low resolution and few snapshots make this dataset ideal for testing.
